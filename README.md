# Project Motivation:
Keep customers satisfied is one of the most successful roles of business,
there is no doubt Starbuckswork to increase customers loyalty. Furthermore,
analyzing data is a method to follow the customer's behavior and guarantee to strive for their satisfaction.
 I  analyzed this dataset to find interesting outcomes and find interesting results. I asked and answered for these:
